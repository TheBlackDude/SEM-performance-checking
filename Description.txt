Search Engine Marketing Performance Checking

METRIC
------
I use the CTR (Click-Through Rate) metric with the Rank Position to check the performance.

REASON
------
I choose the CTR because based on my understanding it is the most important component to get a high
QS (Quality Score).

Because the more Click-Through Rates you have the more Quality Score you will get.
And if you have a high Quality Score you will be on the Top Rank Position, and if you are on the Top Rank Position you will be shown more and you will pay less for the Ad.

And of course the lesser you pay the more Revenue you will get.

EVALUATION
----------
First I will suggest that you put more effort on other continent like America, Asia and Africa.
Second I will seggest that you improve your contents like the Ads make them more attractive and focusing on your best goals at hand, and improve both your online and offline services, so once a customer click your Ads or use your services they will always come back and whenever they see one of your Ads again they'll click them, and they'll also help you market your brand or service.

PROS
----
The CTR approach 1. it Achieves the most possible trafic
                 2. it Increases Quality Score (QS)

CONS
----
The CTR approach 1. it Doesn't care about revenue (ROAS)
                 2. it Doesn't care about conversions (CR, CPA)


MORE TIME
---------
If i have more time i would first read more about the Search Engine Marking (SEM) metrics to understand the differencies between them more and improve the performance check by combining the best metrics to get a very accurate result.
